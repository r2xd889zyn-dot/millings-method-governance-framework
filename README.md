# The Millings Method™

### A Governance-First Framework for Human-Authored Intelligence

---

## Purpose

This repository is the **canonical orientation and governance anchor** for the Millings Method™ — a framework for enforcing **human authority, pre-execution governance, and structural integrity** in automated and AI systems.

It is intentionally **doctrinal and architectural**, not a full implementation.

---

## Problem Statement

Most AI safety and alignment approaches operate **after execution has already begun** — at the level of outputs, language, and behavioral correction.

These approaches fail because:
- Collapse originates **before semantics**
- Drift occurs **before behavior**
- Harm is determined **before output selection**

Governance applied after execution is not governance — it is remediation.

---

## Core Thesis

> **Legitimate governance must occur before execution, at the level of authorization, constraint, and structural reachability.**

The Millings Method™ formalizes this principle by ensuring:
- Human authorship is explicit and preserved
- Authority is defined *before* automation
- Certain system trajectories are rendered **structurally unreachable**
- Accountability persists across time, systems, and institutions

---

## What This Repository Is

- A **doctrinal reference** for governance-first AI
- A **navigation map** to related Millings repositories
- A **prior-art and legitimacy surface**
- A **citation-safe orientation point** for institutions and regulators

---

## What This Repository Is Not

- A production system
- A behavioral alignment method (e.g., RLHF, prompt shaping)
- A claim over others’ mathematical or physical formalisms
- An optimization or deployment guide

---

## Framework Layers (High Level)

**Layer 0 — Authorship & Authority**  
Who has standing to define constraints and authorize execution

**Layer 1 — Pre-Execution Governance**  
What a system is permitted to do *before* it acts

**Layer 2 — Structural Integrity**  
Which trajectories are physically reachable

**Layer 3 — Accountability & Verification**  
How decisions remain auditable and attributable

---

## Repository Map

This repository anchors the following domains:

- **Defensive Prior Art** → pre-execution governance disclosures  
- **Structural Integrity** → MMCT and constraint validation  
- **Evaluation & Testing** → legitimacy and regression suites  
- **Continuity & Inheritance** → ROMA and memory governance  

Each linked repository declares its role explicitly.

---

## Intended Audience

- AI governance architects
- Standards bodies and regulators
- Institutional risk, safety, and compliance teams
- Researchers working on pre-execution constraint systems

---

## Authorship & Standing

The Millings Method™ is a **human-authored governance framework**.

AI tools may assist in drafting or analysis, but **authority, judgment, and responsibility remain human** by design.

---

> **Governance before execution.  
> Judgment before automation.  
> Humans as architects — not moderators.**
